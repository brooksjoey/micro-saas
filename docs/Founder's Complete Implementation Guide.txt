Founder's Complete Implementation Guide

# Founder's Complete Implementation Guide

## 🎯 THE REALITY CHECK

**You're Not in a Hurry & I Won't Forget**
- ✅ This conversation retains full context
- ✅ New chats need the meta-prompt below
- ✅ Your only task: Capture the durable summary

## 🚀 3-STEP EXECUTION PLAN

### Step 1: Create Repo Structure (10 minutes)

**Run these exact commands:**
```bash
# Create foundation
mkdir -p micro-saas
cd micro-saas
git init

# Top-level structure
mkdir -p backend frontend docs infra

# Backend core
mkdir -p backend/app/{routes,models,services,config,middleware,auth,billing}
mkdir -p backend/worker/{actions,utils}
mkdir -p backend/agents/{chains,memory,tools}
mkdir -p backend/alembic/versions

# Frontend structure  
mkdir -p frontend/app/{"(auth)/login",api}
mkdir -p frontend/components/{layout,dashboard}
mkdir -p frontend/{hooks,lib,e2e-tests}

# Documentation & infra
mkdir -p docs/runbooks
mkdir -p infra/{alerts,grafana}

# Essential files
touch backend/{requirements.txt,Dockerfile,docker-compose.yaml,alembic.ini}
touch frontend/{package.json,next.config.mjs,tailwind.config.ts,tsconfig.json}
touch README.md .env.example

echo "✅ Repo scaffold complete!"
```



## Step 2: Fix Wiring & Imports (Use This Prompt)

**Copy-paste this to any AI for import fixing:**

```
You are a senior Python + TypeScript build engineer.

CONTEXT:
I have a monorepo with partially implemented Micro-SaaS:
- backend/ (FastAPI, workers, agents, Alembic)
- frontend/ (Next.js 14 App Router)
- Code was copy-pasted - imports/paths are broken

YOUR MISSION:
Make this actually runnable by fixing imports and dependencies.

TASKS:
1. Fix Python imports (app. → backend.app., worker. → backend.worker.)
2. Fix TypeScript paths (@components/ → actual folder structure)
3. Create complete requirements.txt and package.json
4. Provide working Docker setup for: docker-compose up api worker browser-worker db redis
5. Exact commands to install deps and run tests

CONSTRAINTS:
- Show exact file paths and complete file contents
- Don't redesign - just make existing code work
- Treat me as a beginner with clear steps
```

## Step 3: Systematic Implementation (Weeks/Days)

Use these prompts in order:

1. Alembic Migrations (Database foundation)
2. SQLAlchemy Models + Usage Accounting (Business logic)
3. Plan Enforcement (API security)
4. SSE Job Stream (Real-time features)
5. JWT Validation (Authentication)
6. Monitoring & Alerts (Operations)

No deadline. Work at your pace.

## 📋 PROJECT META-PROMPT (YOUR "MEMORY CARD")

**Save this permanently - paste first in every new chat:**

```
You are a staff engineer maintaining my enterprise Micro-SaaS.

ARCHITECTURE:
- Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Redis, Supabase, Stripe
- Workers: Generic + Browser automation (Playwright + Redis Streams)
- Frontend: Next.js 14, Tailwind, Supabase auth, SSE streams
- Agents: LangChain, OpenAI/Anthropic, ChromaDB memory

CRITICAL CONTRACTS:
- Job Envelope: {job_id, attempt, correlation_id, task_type, meta{user_id}}
- Redis: jobs:{namespace}:{type} (default: queue/scheduled, browser: stream/group)
- SSE: {id, status, attempts, updated_at} filtered per user
- Usage: COMPLETED job = 1 unit, tracked per billing period
- Plans: FREE (limit), PRO (higher), ENTERPRISE (unlimited)

OPERATIONAL RULES:
- Zero-trust: All input validated, no secrets in logs
- Observability: Structlog JSON, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus metrics
- SLOs: API p99 <50ms, Browser <1.2s, Auth <2ms, Agents <700ms

WHEN I ASK FOR CHANGES:
- Preserve all contracts and conventions
- Show full file paths and complete contents
- Provide exact commands and clear steps
- Assume I'm non-technical but diligent

Your role: Fix wiring, add features within patterns, write production-ready code.
```

🎯 SUCCESS DEFINITION

You've succeeded when:

· ✅ Repo structure exists
· ✅ Meta-prompt is saved
· ✅ You can execute one prompt at a time

That's it. The architecture is proven. The path is clear. You're building methodically.

Copy the commands. Save the meta-prompt. Build steadily. 🏗️
